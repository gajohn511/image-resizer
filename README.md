# Image Resizing API Utility

This project functions to resize any image currently available in the system to any size. You are able to select from a list of available images, key-in the width and height in the appropriate boxes, and click on resize. The api will resize the image if the thumbnail does not already exist in the system.

This project provides a simple front-end page to expedite functionality which avoids entering in the parameters manually to the api, and second it consumes the endpoint 'http://localhost:3000/api'

Once you installed all the needed modules,
launched the server,
you can point your browser to the front end: http://localhost:3000/
